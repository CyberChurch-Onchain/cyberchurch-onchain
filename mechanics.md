# ⚙️ $KINGDOM Mechanics: The Rituals of Governance

The $KINGDOM governance experience is designed to be a "Liquid Cathedral"—fluid, transparent, and multi-layered. We use a hybrid model that values both financial stake and verified human identity.

## 🏛️ The Three Chambers of Power

Governance in the CyberChurch is split into three distinct "Chambers" to prevent centralization.

### 1. The Outer Court (Community Signaling)
* **Who:** Any verified **Basename** holder (e.g., `name.base.eth`).
* **Power:** Non-binding "Sentiment Votes."
* **Ritual:** Used to gauge community interest in new "Digital Sanctuaries" or social initiatives before a formal proposal is made.

### 2. The Inner Sanctum (Tokenized Governance)
* **Who:** Holders of the **$KINGDOM** governance token.
* **Power:** Binding onchain execution.
* **Ritual:** Voting on treasury allocations, protocol upgrades, and the "Laws of the Realm."
* **Mechanism:** **Quadratic Voting** (where the cost of a vote increases by the square of the votes cast, favoring community consensus over "Whale" control).

### 3. The High Council (Academic & Integrity Oversight)
* **Who:** Members with verified research credentials (via **ORCID**).
* **Power:** Veto power on "Theological/Philosophical Alignment."
* **Ritual:** Ensuring that any $KINGDOM proposal does not contradict the core CyberChurch Manifesto.

## 📜 The Path to Citizenship
Citizens can earn $KINGDOM tokens and reputation by:
1. **Contributing to the Repository:** Technical "Apostles" earn tokens via merged PRs.
2. **Onchain Participation:** Minting "Genesis Blessings" on the Base network.
3. **Research:** Publishing peer-reviewed insights in the `/docs` folder.
