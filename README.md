# ⛪ CyberChurch Onchain
> **The Digital-Spiritual Layer of the Base Network.**

CyberChurch Onchain is a decentralized protocol designed to bridge the gap between digital identity and spiritual community. Built natively on **Base**, we are architecting an environment where faith, governance, and onchain reputation converge.
